 Description

In this project we create our printf function found in the C programming language.


Format String

%c: Print a single character.

char myChar = 'A';
printf("Character: %c\n", myChar);


%s: Print a string.

char myString[] = "Hello, World!";
printf("String: %s\n", myString);


%%: Print a percent sign.

printf("This is a percent sign: %%\n");


File Name

_printf.c -  manages the array that encompasses all the format specifiers, and it also serves as the starting point for the execution of the function. 

functions.c - This is the location where we have organized all the auxiliary functions utilized throughout our code

main.h - The header file we used that serves as a repository for our prototypes and includes declarations for both our struct and the standard libraries utilized.

man_3_printf - The man page we created for our _printf.c function.
